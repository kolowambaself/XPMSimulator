# Waveform Capture Application
New application

## Notes ( to be organized)
New application
- simple application
- simple GUI ( maybe tkinter)
- records waveforms from osciloscope
- want to be able to quickly test out versions of the fitting function

- make an application that 
- field to enter data path for saving
- saving waveform data
- connects to oscilloscope ( IP address) ( field for this)
- sends HTTP requests to oscilloscope for waveform preamble and waveform
- use waveform preamble to convert waveform into a collumn of times and a column of voltages
- each row has time, voltage
- depending on what preamble says, either 500 ( most likely) or 10k rows
- when launched, connects to oscilloscope, and for every waveform that comes, it will store it

## Timeframe
Started on 02.02.2023
Required in 2 or 3 weeks from 02.02.2023

## Where will it run?
Will be installed on lab PC at SLAC, will run while the XPM is going.
